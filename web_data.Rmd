## Web scraping basics

Load data from website with tables on it
```{r}
url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"

drug_use_html = read_html(url)

drug_use_html
```

Attempt to get pieces I actually need:
```{r}
marj_use_df = 
  drug_use_html |> 
  html_table() |> 
  first() |>
  slice(-1)
```
